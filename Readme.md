# GameLogger
GameLogger is a utility Among Us mod that logs the main events that can occur during a game, allowing people to look over the general round. It writes to .txt files kept at ```your among us folder/GameLogs/``` if on PC or ```Android\data\dev.allofus.starlight\files\GameLogs\``` on Android.

the events it logs about include:
- Kills
- Sabotages
- Meetings
- Tasks
- Game start and end
- Roles

If anyone has suggestions of what else could be recorded do let me know!

# Compatibility
This mod has been designed to work with the vanilla game in mind and does not factor in the presence of other mods so there may be some inaccuracies in that case.
